# Test Python Client for Batch-GPT

This directory contains a test Python client for the Batch-GPT server. It uses the OpenAI Python library to send requests to the local Batch-GPT server, which is designed to handle OpenAI API-compatible requests.

## Purpose

The test client serves several purposes:
1. To verify that the Batch-GPT server is running correctly and accepting requests.
2. To demonstrate how to use the OpenAI Python library to interact with a custom server.
3. To provide a quick way to test new features or changes in the Batch-GPT server.
